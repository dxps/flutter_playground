# How to interact with the application

Right now web IDE does not support mobile applications. So, please, to run this app - use your own local environment. But the IDE is still great for following along and as the reference code. So keep an eye on it if you ever get stuck.

# IDE description

This IDE is part of the `Line-of-Business Mobile Apps with Flutter and Dart` course. It showcases the final, complete version of the application built throughout the course. The app is developed using Flutter, a framework maintained by Google, and Dart, a high-level programming language also maintained by Google.
